548	But there are many new techniques which can help you completely overcome your fear and help you to deal with feelings of anxiety and panic .
549	For example , Cognitive Behavioral Therapy -LRB- CBT -RRB- . CBT will train your mind and therapist can help you to feel as safe as possible in claustrophobic situations .

551	I 've just read about CBT -LRB- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy -RRB- . They have good results .

558	What have I heard ?
559	Why are you leaving your current job ?
560	You have the good career prospects here .
561	I understand that your symptoms are unpleasant .
562	It 's not easy to stop heart racing or sweating .
563	But maybe you will not find the good job , if you avoid travelling on the subway or using a lift .
564	You cannot live with the claustrophobia forever !
565	If you wanted to handle this problem , you 'd better try some new treatments and techniques dealing with it .
566	My aunt started CBT recently and she now feels much better .
567	So , I advice you to think one more time about your decision and change your mind .
568	Your career is going to be very successful in our bank , you hardly can find a better job .
569	I advice you start treatment and see if you have a result , and make your final decision later .
570	Ian , I know about your decision to resign .
571	it was hard for you to make this decision .
572	I know what is claustrophobia , because I my aunt suffers of the same phobia .
573	She is scared of being on eclosed area .
574	She feels anxiety and panic , becomes sweting and even has breathing problems when she has to use transport , elevator or other public places like cinema or theatre .
575	Nowadays there are a lot of methods that treat claustrophobia .
576	Many people who use them are amazed in the improvements , some people overcome their fear completely .
577	Have you ever taken any treatments ?
578	There 're a lot of diffrent pills that can help with breathing problems , shaking , sweating and so on .
579	However , in my opinion drugs only suppress a fear signs but not the reasons .
580	Tablets will n't change the way you think of it .
581	So , to my mind you should go to a specialist , for instance , to a psychologist .
582	I beliave ones find an appropriate treatment for you like CBT -LRB- Cognitive Behavioural Therapy -RRB- or something like that .
583	I think you do n't want to take all your life in panic , feeling of anxiety and looking for exits .

4057	I heard that you are considering to quit this job due to your claustrophobia .
4058	I knew there were people who are afraid of enclosed places , such as a train or elevator , but I did not know how bad your symptoms were .
4059	I read an article about claustrophobia yesterday , and I thought their professional advice might help your current situation .
4060	You already might have tried medication treatment , but there is a therapy session also known as CBT where you can ease your symptoms gradually without medication .
4061	It 's pretty simple .
4062	If you are afraid of subways , visit the therapist and describe your situation .

4080	I did n't realize your feelings and had breathing problems in enclosed space .
4081	I read an article about this and want to give you some advices .
